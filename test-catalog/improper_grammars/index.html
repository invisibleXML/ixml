    <p>Top-level catalog for tests in the iXML Community Group
    Test Suite.</p>
    <p>Tests have been contributed from several sources, but
    the core of the test collection are the tests contributed
    by Steven Pemberton in December 2021.</p>

    <p>This test set collects some grammars which have
    various forms of useless rules.  Some but not all of these
    are non-conforming under the current (2022-06-01) rules of
    ixml.</p>
  </div><div class="description">
    
    <p>Note: This test catalog includes alternate results for
    processors operating in non-standard modes. These are included
    after the result element, wrapped in an app-info element.  The
    app-info element also contains tc:options elements describing the
    conditions under which the result holds. Conditions are assumed to
    be describable by sets of name/value (usually option/setting)
    pairs, expressed on the options element as attribute-value
    specifications. If all the option/setting pairs on any options
    element in the app-info element apply, then any of the results
    specified in the app-info element is acceptable.  (So: for both
    the options elements and the results in the app-info there is an
    implicit disjunction: if any of the options elements applies, then
    any of the results is OK.  For the various name/value pairs on an
    options element, there is an implicit conjunction: the options
    element applies if ALL of the name/value pairs apply.)</p>
    
    <p>In the current state of this catalog, the only options
    specified are in the ap:* namespace; these have the local names
     
      'multiple-definitions', 
      'undefined-symbols',
      'unreachable-symbols', and 
      'unproductive-symbols', 

    with meanings which I hope are obvious.  In all cases, the
    possible values are "error", "warning", and "silence".  In
    non-error cases, the grammar may be rewritten internally to
    eliminate the problem, but unless the user requests that the
    compiled grammar be returned, there is really no way to know
    whether this happens or not.</p>
    
    <p>For strict ixml conformance, the prescribed values are
    
      ap:multiple-definitions = "error", 
      ap:undefined-symbols = "error",
      ap:unreachable-symbols = "warning" or "silence", and 
      ap:unproductive-symbols = "warning" or "silence".
      
    </p>    
    
    <p>Note that the handling of options is experimental and
    subject to change without warning.  Anyone using this test set who
    has opinions or suggestions on the right way to handle such
    options is invited to contact the author.</p>
    
  </div><div class="description">
    <p>Note also that a test-case result of assert-not-a-grammar is
    used here in test cases for what the spec will, I believe,
    eventually describe as dynamic errors in the grammar, or just as
    dynamic errors. (Greetings from the past, o future user!  If in
    your world another result is prescribed, like for instance
    assert-dynamic-error, then you are going to need to update this
    catalog.  The same applies if you want to specify particular error
    codes to be raised for particular test cases.)</p>
