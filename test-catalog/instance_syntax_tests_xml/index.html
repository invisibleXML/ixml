    <p>Top-level catalog for tests in the iXML Community Group
    Test Suite.</p>
    <p>Tests have been contributed from several sources, but
    the core of the test collection are the tests contributed
    by Steven Pemberton in December 2021.</p>

    <p>Syntax tests provided by Steven Pemberton in December 2021.</p>
    <p>Most but not all tests are negative (the file.ixml files do not
    conform to the grammar for ixml).</p>
    <p>Since these are all parsed against the grammar for ixml
    grammars, the expected result could be given as
    'assert-not-a-grammar' as well as 'assert-not-a-sentence'. The
    inputs are not sentences in the language defined by the grammar
    for grammars, which means they are not ixml grammars.</p>
    <p>Three catalogs are provided, using different formulations. This
    one uses the XML form of the ixml grammar and describes all the
    tests as instance tests.</p>
