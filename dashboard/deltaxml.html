<p><a href="https://www.deltaxml.com/">DeltaXML</a> generously provide
an XML Compare license for use in preparing these specifications.
Where possible, this is used to produce a summery of the difference in
the HTML between the branch or pull request being reviewed and the
latest accepted drafts.</p>

<p>The pipeline that produces these versions has been modified slightly from the
stock pipeline provided by XML Compare.</p>

<ol>
<li>Any differences that are only changes in the ID value of an HTML anchor are
elided.</li>
<li>The JavaScript that supports the “view” buttons has been rewritten.</li>
<li>New “previous” and “next” buttons have been added. These attempt to navigate
through the document from one visible set of differences to then next.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/invisiblexml/ixml/issues">open
an issue</a> if you notice an irregularities or errors in the
presentation of these documents.</p>
