  <description>
    <p>A set of grammars differing only in whitespace and comments,
    and a set of inputs differing mostly in size.</p>
    <p>The goal is to try to measure the cost of increased input size.</p>
    <p>Note: There are traces of two distinct designs here: in one,
    each grammar or input is ten times the size of its predecessor,
    and in the other each case doubles in size.</p>
