# XPath performance tests

This directory contains a set of XPath expressions of various lengths
and complexity for use in performance testing.

The goal is to illustrate performance on naturally occurring /
real-world data, as distinct from artificial data constructed for
performance testing.

## Grammar

The grammar is the 'reduced-tree' XPath grammar in the collection of
ixml samples.

## Inputs

The inputs are sample XPath expressions gathered from various sources,
three examples each from:

  * Naxos, an XSLT 1.0 interpreter written in XSLT 1.0 by Debbie
    Pickett  
  * XSLTForms, an XForms processor written in XSLT by Alain Couthures
  * the Docbook xsltNG stylesheets written by Norm Walsh  
  * the Gingersnap collection of XSLT stylesheets for processing ixml
    grammars written by Michael Sperberg-McQueen
