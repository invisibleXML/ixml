	# Revisions:
	# 2022-05-31 : CMSMcQ : Make 'error' attribute obligatory,
	#                       add 'wrong-error' as result.
	# 2022-04-12 : CMSMcQ : Move base version of this to ixml repo
	# 2022-04-11 : CMSMcQ : Add dynamic-error as expected result
	# 2022-02-14 : CMSMcQ : Move metadata from attributes to elements
	# 2022-02-06 : CMSMcQ : Add a quick and dirty report format.
	# 2021-12-22 : CMSMcQ : Make 'created' optional on individual tests;
	#                       notionally, let it be inherited from test set.
	# 2021-11-11 : CMSMcQ : Revamp result to allow multiple results
	#                       and include assert-not-a-grammar.
	#                       Rewrite some comments.
	# 2021-10-31 : CMSMcQ : Commit some changes:  @name on test-case,
	#                       allow at most one grammar for each test
	#                       set (grammars may be inherited from ancestor
	#                       test sets).
	# 2021-01-25 : CMSMcQ : Sketch this out by hand.
        #
	# To do:
	# - rewrite test-set to allow test cases only if a grammar is
	#   specified on the test-set or some ancestor.
	# - allow description to be (p+ | xhtml:div+) HTML
	# - supply types for tokenized attributes?
	#

# Notational convention:  definitions starting in uppercase (e.g.
# Metadata, Grammar-spec are for content-model expressions.
# Definitions starting in lowercase (e.g. test-catalog) are for
# individual elements, usually with the same name as the element.
#
# (Exception:  element test-set has two definitions, test-set-0
# and test-set-1.)

# The normal starting points are test-catalog and test-report.
# But to allow individual test sets and tests to be reported
# separately, we also allow lower-level result elements as the
# start symbol.

	#    set with no direct test-case children, we may just be
	#    pointing to multiple test sets which each provide their

        # Q. Why can't there be multiple grammars?
        # A. First, it's error prone:  it would work only if all of them
	#    were guaranteed equivalent.  We don't want to have to check
	#    that, and we don't want the mess that will result if it
	#    turns out not to be true.  Second, it complicates reporting
	#    unnecessarily.  It's simpler when one test case is one

# Test assertions

        # Several kinds of result are possible.
	#
	# - In the common case we will have one expected XML result.  We
	#   specify it with assert-xml or assert-xml-ref (inline or
	#   external).
	#
	# - For ambiguous sentences, we may and should specify several 
	#   XML results, any of which is acceptable.  So the XML
	#   assertions can repeat, with an implicit OR as their meaning.
	#
	# - In the case of infinite ambiguity, we can and should specify
	#   a finite subset of the expected results, which we add to as
	#   needed.
	#
	# - If the input is not be a sentence in the language defined
	#   by the grammar, we use assert-not-a-sentence.
	#
	# - If the grammar specified is not a conforming ixml grammar, 
	#   then we use assert-not-a-grammar.
	#
	# - If the particular grammar + input pair would produce 
	#   ill-formed output if the normal rules were followed, then
	#   we use assert-dynamic-error.
	#
	# Logically speaking, in the case of a grammar-test, there is no
	# useful distinction between assert-not-a-sentence and
	# assert-not-a-grammar.  Casuists can argue over which makes
	# more sense, but in practice they should be treated as
	# equivalent.  They are usefully different only for normal
	# test cases.
	#
	# Since dynamic errors are allowed to be caught statically,
	# some processors may return assert-not-a-grammar when the test
	# catalog expects assert-dynamic-error.
	#
	# Errors in the grammar and dynamic errors may be associated
	# with error codes.  These are now required.
